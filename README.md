```

In-memory reactivity database engine which can store and restore data to/from JSON files or MongoDB.\
Written in Go for Go.
```
KORN = Keep + Observe + React + eNgine
```
# Quick Start [ 5 steps ]

### 1. Defining
Define your own observable structure or structures.\
Nested structures are allowed.
```go
type User struct {
    korn.Inset `korn:"-" bson:",inline"`
    Name    string `korn:"nameChanged"`
    Enabled bool   `korn:"enabledChanged"`
}
```
Use **korn.Inset** as embedded part of root structure. Tags `korn:"-" bson:",inline"` are requred.\
If you forget **korn.Inset** or tags than your app will catch a panic.\
Also **korn.Inset** contains **Id** and **Updated** fields.\
**Id** field has BSON-tag "_id" and "string" type.\ 
**Updated** field contains last commint date and time.\
*Warning: do NOT add your own Id and Updated fields to your structure. It will cause panic.*\
Tag `korn` contains an action name which will invoke when the field value changes.

### 2. Init Korn
Create basic KORN actors: Engine and Holder.\
Bind reactions names and handlers.\
Make and capture observable targets.

```go
engine := korn.Engine("demo")
holder, err := engine.Holder("users", User{})

holder.Bind("add", addHandler) 
holder.Bind("remove", removeHandler) 
holder.Bind("nameChanged", nameChangedHandler) // one regular event minimum requried
holder.Bind("enabledChanged", enabledChangedHandler)
```
Actions `add` and `remove` nust always be defined and binded.
You can use more than one holder.\ 
Holders count is unlimited but you have to remember that name of holder must be unique.\
If you have many types of data then your scenario is "one holder per one type".

### 3. Don't forget about data storing
Add one of two kinds storages if you need. The storage using is optional.\
You can use NO data storage then your data will be lost after your app close (it is useful case for temporary data).

**JSF** - storage based on simle JSON files (one file per object):
```go
engine.Connect("demo", "") 
engine.Restore() 
```
**MDB** - MongoDB storage:
```go
engine.Connect("korn_mongo_demo", "mongodb://localhost") 
engine.Restore() 
```
Call `Restore()` method if you need to restore last saved data from the storage.

### 4. Make and capture your data
Create and catch some data objects.\
If you are using storage then captured objects will store automatically.
```go
users := map[string]*User{
    "root": user("root"), 
    "bob": user("bob"), 
    "guest": nil,
}
holder.Capture(users) // capture targets 
engine.Activate() // activate the engine > reactivity enabling
```

### 5. Perform
To do somethig with any one target. Or many :)

```go
user := holder.Get("bob").(*User) // getting from the holder and cast to origin type pointer
user.Name = "Bob Smith" // do something
...
user.Enabled = false // do something else
user.Commit() // required for reactivity magic and storing :-)
```
`Commit()` method is needed to cause reactions and save the changes.
Also you can catch errors from reactions.
```go
err := user.Commit() 
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```
For your enjoy you can make a wrapper for the holder and it provides your types casting easy. \
As well all package methods return an error value and your code will stay clean ever :)
